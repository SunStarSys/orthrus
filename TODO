- Refactor Output Formats, making it plugable.

- Refactor UserDB storage, make the whole backend plugable. (support for LDAP storage of OTPs would be nice)

- OSX User Interface for my own sanity.

- Figure out what to do for RFC 2289 / 9.0 PROTECTION AGAINST RACE ATTACK.  The suggestion sucks.
  This isn't an issue that the asf's intended use of orthrus (to manage sudo privs) needs to concern

- ortpasswd could use a bit of humanization in its output.  It's currently spartan and assumes the user already knows what he/she is doing.

- Remove APR-Util dependency (bundle crypto parts needed)

- Investigate dropping APR dependency? (Bundle pocore?)
